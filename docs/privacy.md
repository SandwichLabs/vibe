# Privacy: what leaves your machine

**Slaw sends nothing to Sandwich Labs.** There is no telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting and no account. The one optional lookup of its own is the release check below, which you opt in to. Fonts and icons are bundled with the app (no CDN).

Slaw makes network connections only in the cases below. Everything else stays on your computer.

| Traffic | When | Where to |
|---|---|---|
| **Your connections** | When something uses a connection (a query that names it, `slaw conn test`, expanding it in Studio). Opening a workspace dials nothing remote. | The servers you configured: MotherDuck, Postgres, MySQL, S3, GCS, R2, Azure, and so on. DuckDB makes these connections. |
| **Your LLM provider** | Only if you configure one and use the agent (Studio's chat panel or a notebook AI cell). | The provider you chose in Settings, App (or `slaw config llm`): a local server on your own machine by default, or Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini or Cloudflare AI Gateway. Listing models also asks that provider (or your local server) which models it has. |
| **DuckDB extensions** | Only when you ask for a feature that needs one: the Install button, `--install` on `slaw conn test` or `slaw conn connect`, or the first Excel import or export (about 2 MB, with no separate prompt). Autoinstall and autoload are off, and community extensions are off. | `extensions.duckdb.org`, over HTTPS, into Slaw's own folder. The `motherduck` extension comes from there too. |
| **GitHub, in your browser** | Only when you click Report a bug, Apache-2.0 licence or Privacy in Settings, About, or confirm an `http(s)` link in a notebook's Markdown cell. Studio opens the link in your default browser; these links do not make Slaw itself talk to GitHub (the opt-in update check below is the only GitHub traffic Slaw makes on its own). | `github.com` (or the link's own site). Nothing is prefilled: no workspace names, paths or data. |
| **Update check (opt-in)** | Studio asks once, on a release build, "Check GitHub for new Slaw releases?"; **Check weekly** allows one request at startup when the last check is over seven days old, **No thanks** (the default until you answer) allows none. **Check now** in Settings, About, Updates and `slaw update` are explicit: pressing or running them is the consent for that one check, whatever the setting. `slaw config updates off\|weekly` mirrors the toggle. Development builds never ask or check on their own. | Plain HTTPS GETs, with the `User-Agent: slaw-update` (no version, no identifier) and no cookies, tokens or workspace data (GitHub sees your IP address, as it does for any web request): `github.com/SandwichLabs/slaw/releases/latest` (the redirect names the newest tag) and, only when a newer release exists, `api.github.com` for its notes. Installing is a separate, confirmed step: it downloads that release's `install.sh` and `checksums.txt` from `github.com` (redirects only to GitHub's own hosts), checks the script's SHA-256, and runs it; the installer then downloads the archive from `github.com`. Your choice, the last check time and a skipped version are saved in Studio's preferences file, never in a workspace. |
| **AWS sign-in (opt-in, per connection)** | Only for an S3 connection you set to sign in with an AWS SSO profile (`aws-sso:PROFILE`), when a workspace that uses it opens, when it is used, or when you press Sign in. Slaw never contacts AWS for it otherwise, and `slaw mcp serve` never starts a sign-in. | AWS IAM Identity Center in the profile's `sso_region` (`oidc.<region>.amazonaws.com`, `portal.sso.<region>.amazonaws.com`), over HTTPS; the sign-in page itself opens in your browser (`*.awsapps.com` or `device.sso.<region>.amazonaws.com`). The SSO access token is kept in `~/.aws/sso/cache`, the AWS CLI's own cache (readable only by you), and shared with `aws sso login`; the short-lived role keys stay in memory. |
| **Your own SQL** | When you write SQL that reads a URL (`read_csv('https://...')`) or a storage path. | That URL or storage. This is your query, run as written. Reading an `https://` URL needs the `httpfs` extension, which a storage connection loads; your own SQL cannot `INSTALL` or `LOAD` extensions. |
| **Loopback only** | MCP over SSE and Studio's MCP proxy. | `127.0.0.1` on your machine, with a random bearer token. Nothing is exposed to the network. |

## The LLM provider sees your data

This is the one place your data can leave your computer by design, so be clear about it. When you ask the agent a question, the provider you configured receives what the agent needs to answer: your prompt, table and column names and types, the rows your queries return (within a result-size limit), and the skills it reads. Slaw never sends credentials or the contents of your keychain to the model.

- If you use a **local model** (the default endpoint is `http://localhost:8080/v1`, or Ollama on localhost), nothing leaves your machine.
- If you use a **hosted provider**, its own terms and retention rules apply to those prompts and results.
- If you configure **no provider**, the agent does nothing and nothing is sent. SQL, notebooks, connections and `slaw mcp serve` all work without one.
- **External agents** (Claude Code and others over MCP) are your agent talking to your model provider. What they read through Slaw's tools is governed by [the same limits](mcp-clients.md#what-the-client-may-do), and by that client's own privacy terms.

Credentials stay in your OS keychain or environment variables. They never appear in the workspace folder, a `.slaw` bundle, log lines, error messages shown to the UI or the agent, or anything the agent can read.

## Proposed definitions stay on this machine

When an agent proposes a semantic definition (`propose_definition`), the proposal is a file in `.slaw-local/proposals/` in the workspace folder. That folder is git-ignored and is never read into a `.slaw` bundle, so a proposal, its rationale and its evidence are not committed, shared or exported. Nothing is sent anywhere because of it. Only when you accept a proposal does its definition become a file under `semantics/`, which git and bundles do carry.

## HTML pages that ask the model

A scripted HTML page can declare `ask`, which sends text the page chose (it may include query results) to the model provider you set in Settings > App, the same one the agent uses. The prompt that asks you to allow the page names that provider. You can switch `ask` off for one page in Settings > Workspace > Pages, which also lists recent uses (when, how many bytes; never the text). A scripted page on macOS can also open a network connection to an address it chooses, though it cannot read a reply; on Linux it has no network at all. Pages never see your credentials.

## How to check this yourself

This page was checked against the code (pre-0.1.0 source). The Go code makes outbound requests itself in exactly three places. Two go to addresses you configured, the third to GitHub and only after you opted in or asked:

- `internal/llm/models.go`: lists models from the configured provider endpoint.
- `internal/mcp/proxy.go`: connects to the local MCP server on loopback.
- `internal/selfupdate`: the release check and, after you confirm, the installer download (the update row above).

Everything else goes through DuckDB (connections, extension downloads, URL reads) or the LLM provider SDK for the provider you selected, the system browser, or the installer that `slaw update` runs (`install.sh`, which downloads the release archive from `github.com`). There are no analytics or crash-reporting libraries in the Go code or in the Studio frontend. You can confirm with `grep -rn "http\.\(Get\|NewRequest\|Client\)" internal cmd studio` and by running Slaw under a firewall or `strace -e trace=connect`.

An air-gapped machine works: the only first-use download is a DuckDB extension, and you can copy a populated extension folder from another machine running the same Slaw version (`~/.cache/slaw/duckdb/extensions` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches/slaw/duckdb/extensions` on macOS). See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#extension-download-blocked-or-offline).

## Reporting a privacy problem

If you find Slaw sending something this page does not list, that is a bug. Report it privately as described in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
