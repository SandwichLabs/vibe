// useLiveQuery — the live "sql" binding of an A2UI component (F5), shared by
// stat, table, barChart and lineChart. A data-bound component's sql re-runs every
// time it mounts, so what it shows is whatever the data is now, not what the
// agent saw when it wrote the component. The query goes through the shared
// concurrency pool at 'low' priority (a user's Run never waits behind it) and
// honours the host's abort signal: a result that resolves after the page was
// unmounted or reloaded is dropped, never applied to state that moved on.
