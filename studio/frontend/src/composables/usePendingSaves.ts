// usePendingSaves — a shared registry of "I have a debounced save that
// might not have fired yet" flush functions (review fix, step 4a round 2
// #1). Reproduced bug: AppShell's closeFile() called CloseFile() directly,
// which closes (and Save()s) the container server side; NotebookView's own
// flush (on unmount, once AppShell's file-closed event propagates and
// unmounts it) then ran AFTER the container was already gone, so its
// SaveNotebook call failed with "no file open" and the error was silently
// swallowed — a pending edit was lost.
//
// Fix: any view holding a debounced save registers its flush function here
// on mount and unregisters on unmount. AppShell's close path (and the app
// quit flow driven by Wails' OnBeforeClose, see App.vue) awaits flushAll()
// BEFORE calling CloseFile/Quit, so the flush runs while the container is
// still open and its result — success or failure — is not lost.
//
// Round 3 review fix: a failed flush used to still let the file close (the
// registered flush caught its own error so flushAll always resolved
// cleanly) — the toast NotebookView set then unmounted along with the
// view, and the edit was gone with no way for the person to stop the
// close. Now the flush registered here is expected to REJECT on failure —
// see NotebookView's doFlush — and flushAll reports every failure by label
// so a caller (AppShell.closeFile, UnlockView.openFile) can ask the person
// whether to proceed anyway instead of silently losing the edit.
