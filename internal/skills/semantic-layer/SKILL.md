# Semantic layer

`semantics/` holds reviewed definitions (entities, metrics, joins, a
glossary) that dashboards and answers build on. A metric is a measure over a
**saved query**; a wrong saved query makes every number built on it wrong, and
`metric()` will not notice. Do these checks before you write a definition.
Field-by-field reference: `docs/reference/semantics.md`; the tool reference is
`help_search "semantics"`.

## 1. Grain first

Before a metric, state the saved query's grain ("one row per night") and
prove it. Profile the source (`SUMMARIZE <table>`, see `data-profiling`), then
count rows per intended key:

```sql
SELECT log_date, count(*) AS n FROM <the saved query's FROM> GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

Zero rows means one row per key. Any rows mean a sum or average over that key
is wrong. Check what the key's date means too: a timestamp stamped by **start
time** puts an event that crosses midnight, or two sessions in one day, on
dates you did not expect.

Worked example: a sleep table stamped by start time had two nights sharing a
date. The saved query combined the two nights into one row per date, adding
their scores, and the metric's average came back as 106.1 on a 0-100 scale.
The grain query above found the repeated dates at once; the fix was to
collapse to one row per date in the saved query (`max_by` / a window, or pick
the main sleep), then re-check. A number outside its possible
range is a grain bug until proven otherwise.

## 2. Double-sourced rows

Two sources often record the same event (a workout from one app and a
tracker, the same night from two devices). Look for overlap on the grain key
across the source column:

```sql
SELECT log_date, count(DISTINCT source_id) AS sources, count(*) AS n
FROM <table> GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(DISTINCT source_id) > 1 LIMIT 20;
```

If the same key appears under more than one source, decide which source wins
and filter or dedup in the saved query, then re-run section 1. Say so in the
metric's `description` or `settled_by` so the choice is reviewable.

## 3. Assertions to declare

An assertion is a counted violation, run by `slaw semantics check`. The kinds
are closed:

- entity `unique` on the `id_column`, and `not_null` on the columns you rely on;
- entity `accepted_values` on a status or category column that a `CASE` or filter depends on (compared as text, case-sensitive);
- entity `range` (`min`, `max` or both) on a numeric column with a known scale (a 0 to 100 score, a price that cannot be negative);
- entity `freshness` (`column`, `max_age` as `7d` or `36h`) on the date or timestamp a dashboard depends on being current; an empty table is stale;
- entity `row_count` (`min_rows`) so an empty or truncated load is noticed;
- metric `non_negative` for a count, sum or amount; metric `not_null` when a gap would mislead;
- metric `range` (`min`, `max` or both) on the metric's value at its full dimension set, such as an average on a 0 to 100 scale;
- metric `unique`, which checks that the **saved query** has one row per dimension set (needs at least one dimension). This is what finds the fan-out and the double-sourced night of section 2: the metric's own output is grouped, so it cannot show duplicates, but the rows under it can.

In a definition, an entity assertion names its column (except `row_count`) and
a metric assertion takes none. Bounds are plain numbers (unquoted, no
exponent); `max_age` needs its unit:

```yaml
# entity
assertions:
  - {kind: unique, column: id}
  - {kind: accepted_values, column: status, values: [open, closed]}
  - {kind: range, column: score, min: 0, max: 100}
  - {kind: freshness, column: log_date, max_age: 7d}
  - {kind: row_count, min_rows: 1}
```

```yaml
# metric
dimensions: [log_date]
assertions:
  - {kind: non_negative}
  - {kind: unique}
  - {kind: range, min: 0, max: 100}
```

Declare metric `unique` only when the saved query is meant to be at the
metric's grain (one row per night, say). A query of raw rows measured by
region would rightly fail it. A failed `freshness` or `row_count` says what it
saw (`stale: latest 2026-09-30`, `too few rows: 0 rows`); the others report a
count of violating rows. They do not replace section 1: they keep the answers
you found there true as the data changes. `check` exits 1 when any check
fails, otherwise 2 when some could not run: a run where every row errors
verified nothing.

Each entity and metric gets a `compile` row first: its table and columns, or
its measure and dimensions against the saved query, are bound on the real
connection without scanning rows. `slaw semantics check --compile` runs only
those, fast enough after every edit; run it before the full `check`.

## 4. Using `metric()`

```sql
SELECT * FROM metric('avg_sleep_score', by => 'log_date');
SELECT * FROM metric('revenue', by => ['region', 'month']);
```

The grammar is only `metric('name')`, `metric('name', by => 'dim')` or
`by => ['dim', ...]`, with plain quoted literals. There is no `where =>`, time
grain or parameter in the call, and `by` takes only the metric's declared
`dimensions`. The result column is named after the metric. A metric runs on
its saved query's connection, so the statement must run on that connection
(`slaw query -c <conn>`, or the cell's connection).

**A window: filter outside.** Put one `WHERE` on the expansion:

```sql
SELECT * FROM metric('avg_sleep_score', by => 'log_date')
WHERE log_date >= current_date - 30 ORDER BY log_date;
```

It can only filter a dimension or the metric value. If the window belongs in
the data, give the saved query a `$since` parameter with a default such as
`today-30d`. The Query Explorer, `slaw query` and the console run it with
that default; through `run_query` you pass a value in `params`.

**A derived number across two metrics: join by hand.** There is no derived
metric. Join the two expansions on their shared dimensions (same connection):

```sql
SELECT d, i.calories_in - o.calories_out AS balance
FROM metric('calories_in', by => 'd') i
JOIN metric('calories_out', by => 'd') o USING (d);
```

An inner join drops a day either side lacks; use `FULL OUTER JOIN` and say so
if the gap matters.

## 5. Propose, don't write

Agents never write under `semantics/`. File a definition with
`propose_definition` (`kind`, `name`, `definition`, `rationale`, and
`evidence`: the queries or values you checked, for example the grain result).
It is validated now and waits in the person's inbox; **nothing changes and
`metric()` will not find it until they accept it** (`slaw semantics proposals`,
`accept`, `reject`, or Studio). Save the query first (`save_query`), since a
metric's saved query must exist. To change a definition send the `rev` from
`get_definition` as `replaces_rev`. Do not use a proposed definition in
answers until accepted. Use `list_definitions` first: reuse a name that
exists rather than proposing a near-duplicate.

From a shell: `slaw semantics list`, `show <kind> <name>`, `check`, `profile
<join>`. Run `check` after the person accepts, and report what passed and what
could not run.
