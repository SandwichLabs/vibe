// connection's, or the keychain), with whatever was typed in this edit laid
// over it. rc is the definition being tested: the saved one, or an edit of it.
//
// Server-changed guard: when rc differs, in any fingerprint field, from the
// saved definition, or the saved sign-in is no longer bound to the saved
// definition (a pull changed it), no stored credential of any method (keychain,
// environment or prompt) is used. Only typed values are. When the type needs a
// secret and none was typed (a prefilled user name is not a secret), it returns
// *secrets.ErrFingerprintChanged and no credential. A connection that does not
// exist yet has nothing stored, but an environment sign-in the person chose for
// it is theirs to use.
//
// A failure to find a stored credential is returned as err only when nothing
// typed made up for it; the (possibly partial) credential comes back with it,
// and a caller that wants Test to report the missing credential may ignore err
// unless it is *secrets.ErrFingerprintChanged.
