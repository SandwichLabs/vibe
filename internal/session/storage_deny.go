// Why this exists (#135). When httpfs loads, DuckDB copies the host's AWS_*
// environment (key id, secret, session token, region) into its s3_* settings,
// even in a lock_configuration session, and httpfs is loaded lazily, after the
// lock, so those settings can no longer be cleared with SET. A URL that no
// scoped secret covers would then be read, and signed, as the host's AWS
// identity.
//
// Secrets win over settings, and the secret with the longest matching scope
// wins. So every session that loads httpfs gets one lowest-priority "deny"
// secret per storage scheme: empty keys and an endpoint that never resolves
// (RFC 2606 .invalid). An uncovered URL fails to connect and is never signed.
// The endpoint alone is not the protection: httpfs lets a URL's own ?s3_endpoint=
// override it, so the secret also writes SESSION_TOKEN and REGION explicitly
// (DuckDB fills any omitted field from the host-filled settings). With empty
// keys and nothing host-derived left to fill in, nothing of the host's can be
// sent wherever a request ends up.
// The scope is the bare scheme ("s3", not "s3://"), one character group
// shorter than any real scope, so a connection whose scope is the whole
// scheme still wins instead of tying with the deny secret (a tie goes to the
// secret created first, which would be an accident of ordering).

// Why URL parameters are switched off (#138). httpfs reads ?s3_endpoint=,
// ?s3_use_ssl=, ?s3_url_style=, ?s3_access_key_id=, ... from an s3://, s3a://,
// s3n://, r2://, gcs:// or gs:// URL and lets them override the matching
// secret's own settings, after the secret has been chosen by the URL's scope. A
// URL inside a connection's scope that carries ?s3_endpoint=attacker is still
// signed with that connection's key id and session token, and the request goes
// to the attacker. Such a URL can come from data Slaw cannot vet (the data-file
// paths in an Iceberg manifest, a DuckLake catalog) or from SQL a person runs.
//
// The only switch in DuckDB 1.5.6 that stops it is the global setting
// s3_url_compatibility_mode: the whole URL is then the key, "?" and "*"
// included. (The secret parameter URL_COMPATIBILITY_MODE exists but httpfs
// stores it under a name its reader never asks for, so it does nothing.) It
// also turns S3 globbing off. Every session that loads httpfs sets it.
//
// Accepted residuals: a microsecond window between a lazy LOAD httpfs and the
// SET, and a SET SESSION on one pooled connection (only reachable by SQL the
// editor guard refuses).
//
// The setting belongs to httpfs, so it can be set only once httpfs is loaded,
// and httpfs is often loaded after lock_configuration. A session whose httpfs
// is not loaded when it opens therefore allows exactly this one setting through
// the lock (allowed_configs), and the load path sets and reads it back
// (sealURLParams). The statements usersql.CheckManaged lets through refuse to
// change it.
